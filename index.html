            <p id="p6">There are many stories of the Jeep that demonstrate it's capacities. Pretty much every Jeep owner can tell his own. It's a matter of pride to be able to sit around a campfire and share off roading stories over a grilled steak and a cold beer. Many were the days when off road enthusiasts would camp out under the stars with only a tent, their Jeep, and a campfire! The trails and the the cool nights in the great outdoors lured many to return to nature. Jeeps helped make this whole experience possible. And there's nothing like a meal cooked over a campfire. Also, the Jeep offered ample space to either carry along a couple of guest or store your camping gear. Oh, and don't forget those spare parts! I once saw a girl with a broken-down Jeep pull an axle out of a box in the rear of her vehicle! Boy, was she prepared that day. Jeepers never know what kind of trouble they'll run into on the trails, but one thing is for sure-they need to be prepared.</p>

                <p>Camping is a favorite pastime for Jeep enthusiasts. The smell of the campfire, the roasting of marshmallows, hot dogs grilled to a blackened state are all great fodder for camping memories. And Jeeps are perfect to take you to places inaccessible to many other vehicles. Cool breezes and bright stars await the camper at night. It is the perfect time spinning a yarn or telling a tall tale to friends and family who are willing to believe. Don't forget the rope around the tent!</p>

            <p>Jeeps have a long and complex history. They began their life as the US Army's answer to the need for an all-terrain lightweight general purpose vehicle. They served in every theater of WW2 and the Korean Conflict. The Jeeps proved their worth under fire, in mud and sand, and winter's cold. Originally contracted to the Willys corporation, they were also built by the Ford motor company, the demand being so great. The name "Jeep" was sold to Willys after the war, who then began to make a civilian version, and the CJ was born. Jeeps have come a long way since then, but even today they remain highly regarded in the off-road community. <span id="span1">Jeep clubs are located pretty much everywhere in the United States and many foreign countries</span>. We have Jeep shows, Jeep Jambories, and many other types of Jeep events. Jeep's followers are devoted and passionate.</p>
